## Description

Frontend for a wine manager application. The corresponding backend for my usage can be found on [this repo](https://github.com/lapostoj/winemanager). The language of the UX is French due to the use I had for it.

## Technology

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The UI components come from [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## How to use

The usage is based on standard npm commands (`npm start | test | deploy`) and the `react-scripts` from Create React App.
